# Key Workflows

### Initial Document Creation

1. User opens application for the first time
2. Presented with clean editor interface
3. Creates first document content
4. On first save:
   - System creates "Main Branch"
   - Generates first version
   - Enables timeline and branch features
   - Shows success confirmation

### Branch Creation

1. User selects version in Timeline View
2. Clicks "Create Branch"
3. System:
   - Generates next branch name
   - Creates branch record
   - Copies selected version content
   - Switches to Editor View

### Version Navigation

1. User selects branch from dropdown
2. Uses version slider to navigate
3. System:
   - Updates view to selected version
   - Shows read-only content
   - Enables branch creation from this point

### Content Editing

1. User enters Editor View
2. Makes content changes
3. Saves new version:
   - Creates version record
   - Updates branch currentVersionId
   - Returns to Timeline View

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of branch visualization
- Debounced version saving
- Cached version content
- Optimized branch switching
